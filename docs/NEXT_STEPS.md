6. ✅ Add Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular)

**Success Criteria:**
- See your first voxel ship in 3D ✅
- Move camera around ship ✅
- Capture demonstration screenshots (recommended next step)

**Graphics Implementation Details:**
- **Files:** GraphicsWindow.cs, Camera.cs, VoxelRenderer.cs, Shader.cs
- **Location:** AvorionLike/Core/Graphics/
- **Access:** Option 10 in the main menu ("3D Graphics Demo")
- **Controls:** WASD (move), Space/Shift (up/down), Mouse (look), ESC (exit)

This system:
- ✅ Proves the concept works
- ✅ Provides visual feedback
- ✅ Enables further UI development
- 🎯 Next: Build UI framework on top

## After Pass400

Pause broad feature expansion. Next work should be player-facing integration and defect-driven production polish: wire the new Pass361-400 authorities into the Win32 client, replace remaining legacy interior/cutaway UI paths, finish real 3D galaxy/System Map rendering, station visual/content density, PI GUI/content, fleet autopilot binding, audio, performance, persistence migrations, and screenshot-level visual acceptance.
